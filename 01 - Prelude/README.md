# Part One - Prelude

So you want to get started writing CosmWasm smart contracts? Where do I start? What do I need? Can I even do this? Well firstly I’m going to go through some base knowledge which I expect you to have. Don’t worry if you don’t have these yet, these will be accompanied by links to get you in the right direction!

1. Ability to write rust code OR previous experience in learning programming languages on the fly
   - I recommend either having experience learning languages fast. Or if picking up rust for the first time running through some tutorials
   - Here are some Rust resources to get you started
     - [Traversy Media Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw)
     - [Rust Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMJlQ5B-M0&list=PLVvjrrRCBy2JSHf9tGxGKJ-bYAN_uDCUL)
1. Basic Git and VCS understanding. I post this series part-by-part on GitHub and recommend you use GitHub too!
   - Resources:

     - [FreeCodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
1. Comfortable using a terminal and CLI
   - We will be running alot of commands from the terminal. Preferably you should use a Unix terminal.
   - I recommend a Mac (Pre-M1 Chipset) or an Ubuntu work machine.
     - A workaround for windows is to use WSL Ubuntu. A tutorial for this is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-DHaQLrBi8)

Right that seems like a lot but I need to make these assumptions, this will be talking about smart contract structure and coding. It will not be explaining what an if statement does, calling functions etc.

Learning will take time, but take it at your own pace. Don’t burn yourself out, take regular breaks and pick up where you left off. This is instrumental if you feel yourself getting frustrated, it’s time to do something else.

Also I promise sections will be smaller from now, I just had to cover my bases.
